# ðŸ“¦ Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Native splash screen

Splash screen configuration with available options is available in `flutter_native_splash.yaml`.
Any changes to this file have to be followed by running `flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create` command.

> This is a solution for masking the initial load time of Flutter engine. If the app does
> something time consuming before displaying meaningful content to the user consider
> adding a splash screen widget to mask such wait time.
